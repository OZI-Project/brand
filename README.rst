OZI Logo
^^^^^^^^

The original OZI Project logo was designed by Eden Ross Duff MSc by
layering the letters "OZI" in Latin Modern Mono. This logo is used for our
documentation webpages.

      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OZI-Project/brand/main/images/ozi_logo_master.png" class="dark:invert" width="200px"></img>

This was then rescaled
to approximate the small cap version x-height, making the logo roughly
square. The overlapping serifs were then removed and the outer strokes
were transformed spherically to yield the second version of the logo
that is currently in use for the OZI Project and the OZI package.

:superscript:`*` Note that the sole exception is the OZI Badge |ozi-badge|
which uses an ink-bleed effect.
You should NOT do this with the OZI logo yourself, this is the only logo
variant currently authorized.

blastpipe logo

The blastpipe logo was designed by Eden Ross Duff.

Generative AI Transparency
--------------------------

.. epigraph::

   I, like many, have strong feelings about the use of generative AI.
   However, outright rejection of any AI-generated content is an infeasably
   strong rubric. I believe that we should make every endeavour to account
   for ANY use of generative AI and mark it appropriately while also marking
   copy that is wholly human-created as such.
