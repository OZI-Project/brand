## Fonts

The OZI Project prefers to present english language copy in Atkinson Hyperlegible,
treated as a sans-serif. For specialized emphasis and serif we prefer Noto Serif HK.
For monospace and code presentation we prefer Martian Mono. All of these fonts are hosted
here for use in OZI Project webpages and services.
