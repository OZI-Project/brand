### OZI Logo

The original OZI Project logo was designed by Eden Ross Duff MSc by layering the letters "OZI" in
Latin Modern Mono. This was then rescaled to approximate the small cap version x-height,
making the logo roughly square. The overlapping serifs were then removed and the outer strokes
were transformed spherically to yield the second version of the logo that is currently in use.

## Generative AI Transparency

I, like many, have strong feelings about the use of generative AI. However, outright rejection of any AI-generated content is an infeasably strong rubric. I believe that we should make every endeavour to account for ANY use of generative AI and mark it appropriately while also marking copy that is wholly human-created as such.
