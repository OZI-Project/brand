## Fonts

The OZI Project prefers to present english language copy in Atkinson Hyperlegible,
treated as a sans-serif. For specialized emphasis and serif we prefer Noto Serif HK.
For monospace and code presentation we prefer Martian Mono. The preferred font for logo
lockup is Latin Modern Mono for the OZI application and Atkinson Hyperlegible for the greater
OZI Project organization.

## Logos

The original OZI Project logo was designed by Eden Rose MSc by layering the letters "OZI" in
Latin Modern Mono. This was then rescaled to approximate the small cap version x-height,
making the logo roughly square. The overlapping serifs were then removed and the outer strokes
were transformed spherically to yield the second version of the logo that is currently in use.
